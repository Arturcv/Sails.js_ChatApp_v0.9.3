# Sails.js_ChatApp_v0.9.3
### a Sails application

This app is based on the "Working with data in Sails.js" tutorial by Gabriel Manricks on net.tutsplus.com. The code base has been updated to use the latest version of Sails.js v0.9.3, and comments have been added where the code differs from the original tutorial.

Please also check out the branches, which provide examples of working with Backbone, Requirejs, Bower and Angular.

Feel free to create issues or pull request where the code could be improved (especially on the branches, since I am new to some of the libraries in use).
